    <p>Hey there. Born and raised on the East coast, I live Miami which has been my home for the last decade. 
    I have a passion for technology and design that borders on eccentic obsession. I have worked in large teams 
    and on my own from projects ranging from basic web design all the way to full documentary films and nearly 
    everything in between, including marketing, graphic design. Ruby is my newest flame, and shes amazing on Rails.</p> 
    <p>A bit more about myself; my wife and I bake all our own bread (she's way better at it). I have a boyhood love for
    gaming and I absolutely love live music, particularly Phish. I have climbed the tallest church tower in the world 
    as well as thethe highest mountain on the Appalachian trail, and my favorite hobby and traveling is my favorite
    hobby. To quote Mark Twain, "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people
    need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by 
    vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime."</p>
    <p>Feel free to reach out and say hi, I love learning new things and meeting new people, whatever the reasons!</p>
